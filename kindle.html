            <p class="subtitle process-description">The three of us began our project by putting together and sending out a survey screener to get a sense of who we should interview. From the responses to these questions, we wanted to see if our potential interviewees would fall under the category of our target users (ebook readers). We also got a basic sense of what products these individuals, use and their habits surrounding these products. After receiving 15 responses to our survey, we found 9 potential interviewees, and my teammate and I proceeded to interview 7 of them.</p>

            <p class="subtitle process-description">My team researched competing reading apps. As it turns out, some of our interviewees were familiar with several of these competitors, including: iBooks, nook, GoodReads, and Glose. It wasn’t enough to analyze just any reading app, however. As we were tasked with creating for Kindle a social experience around books, it was important to look at what apps combined a reading experience with a social experience. Of the four, we decided that the most effective of such social reading apps were GoodReads and Glose, and focused on them.</p>

            <p class="subtitle process-description">Having completed our User Research via interviews, my teammate and I proceeded to do an <b>Affinity Mapping</b>. This process included taking single insights from our interviews and writing them on post-it notes. We then took these post-it notes, put them on a white board, and then organized them by common points. Doing so allows for trends to naturally emerge.</p>

            <h2 class="title-1 process-headline">Personas</h2>
            <p class="subtitle process-description">Using these trends, we developed <b>personas,</b> that is, fictional users of our app. This process is key in humanizing and giving our eventual users a face, and allowing us to design with these specific personas, "Danny" and "Phillipa," in mind. The trends that would later coalesce under our primary persona “Danny” included his <b>habits</b> and <b>needs</b> as an e-book reader.</p>

            <h2 class="title-1 process-headline">Feature Prioritization</h2>
            <p class="subtitle process-description">Bringing together our research findings, the three of us listed all possible features that we could adopt from competitors, but also features that our personas would clearly need.</p>
            <p class="subtitle process-description">We began this process by listing all features, then narrowing the ones that we must focus on by priority. We achieved this in various ways: by weighing the importance of the feature to the business (Amazon), to each persona (while weighing features important to our primary persona Danny more than those important to our other persona), and ultimately labeling these features by which we Must, Should, Could, and Won’t (<b>MoSCoW Method</b>) focus on.</p>

            <h2 class="title-1 process-headline">Sketching</h2>
            <p class="subtitle process-description">With these must-have features in mind, the three of us began sketching wireframes through the Design Studio technique. This technique involved us sketching 6–8 sketches each, with a specific feature or screen in mind for 5 minutes. Afterwards, we would explain quickly present our sketches to each other, critique each other, and go through several other rounds of sketching all while adopting design concepts from each other and improving our own designs. After a couple of rounds, we ended with <b>76 sketches</b> and began coalescing our common concepts into single design screens.</p>

            <h2 class="title-1 process-headline">Lo-Fidelity Usability Testing</h2>
            <p class="subtitle process-description">With our now single design concept in mind, I sketched out lo-fidelity wireframes, from which a prototype could be designed using the POP app, an app that allows for rapid prototyping by using photos of wireframes. We tested our app with three people and were able to gather feedback we then iterated and applied to our higher fidelity prototype</p>

            <h2 class="title-1 process-headline">Moving Forward</h2>
            <p class="subtitle process-description">There were several features that fell into our Should &amp; Could categories when conducting our feature prioritization, that we felt would be a solid logical direction for the app to head in.</p>
            <p class="subtitle process-description">Among these potential features there are a public, SoundCloud-inspired, "Leave A Note" sidebar. A second feature would be "ReadWithMe" emulating social reading apps such as GoodReads that allow users to track other users’ progress when reading books. A third ppossible feature would allow users to answer a short list of general questions regarding a book to avoid overly-detailed reviews that would give essentially away a book's plot</p>
