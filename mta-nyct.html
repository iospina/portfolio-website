This included research into the MTA’s history as a company, but also the MetroCard’s history, as that gave us more data that assisted us in our project. For example, as the MetroCard has been in use since 1994 (with Vending Machines in use since 1999), we can surmise that the current card purchasing system is an outdated one; this system was designed in a time before people had quick access to online purchasing.</p>

            <p class="subtitle process-description">Though the MTA New York City Transit does not have any true competitors, we decided to look into the apps and websites of <b>comparable</b> transit systems in other cities–apps/sites that do allow users to refill and manage their transit passes. The transit passes that we chose included the NJ Transit pass, Boston’s CharlieCard, Washington D.C.’s smarTrip, Shenzhen’s Tong, and San Francisco’s ClipperCard.</p>
            <p class="subtitle process-description">With these other businesses’ apps/sites’ successes and pain points in mind, we set out to create our app by emulating their strong points, and avoiding their weaknesses/complexities.</p>

            <p class="subtitle process-description">For further analysis, our design team also completed several user and task flows for the above transit systems. Doing so gives us a better sense of what flow our own eventual app should emulate (or avoid).</p>
            <p class="subtitle process-description">An additional benefit is that it allows us to quantify the number of steps it takes a user to complete a task. With these numbers in mind, we provided ourselves with a <b>goal, a number of steps we were targeting to meet</b>.</p>

These personas allow us designers to design while keeping our users in mind, making sure they were are catering to their <b>needs</b> and including that which <b>pleases</b> them (and excluding that which <b>irritates</b> them).</p>
            <p class="subtitle process-description">With Melinda, our primary persona, in mind, my design team and I created a <b>scenario</b> for Melinda, who needed a way to set up an auto-fill option for her MetroCard. This scenario begins setting the stage for us to begin design, by having us to focus on what specific task our user wishes to complete (auto-fill MetroCard), and what screens are necessary for Melinda to complete her task.</p>

            <h2 class="title-1 process-headline">Feature Prioritization</h2>
            <p class="subtitle process-description">With multiple forms of research completed, we now had a sense of what kind of features MTA commuters would want in a design solution to their problem (i.e., to give them the option of MetroCard purchasing online, and on-the-go), and what kind of features comparable transit systems’ apps included.</p>
            <p class="subtitle process-description">Listing all of our features, my team of designers and I prioritized them via two methods. The first included plotting our features on a graph, with their positions depending on the <b>impact</b> it would have on commuters when trying to complete a tack, and also to what degree a commuter would <b>expect</b> a feature. Features that we would especially warrant implementation are those that have a high impact on commuters, but would also be unexpected.</p>
            <p class="subtitle process-description">The second method of prioritization was by categorizing features under four categories: Must Have Features, Should Have Features, Could Have Features, and Won’t Have Features, (<b>MoSCoW method</b>).</p>

Through the <b>design studio</b> method of rapid, collaborative sketching, we produced <b>31 sketches in 10 minutes</b>. After several rounds of sketching, we produced home screens and profile screens, giving users the options to add value/time to their MetroCards, access their own accounts, as well as see their transaction history and card usage history.</p>

            <h2 class="title-1 process-headline">Google Material design Research</h2>
            <p class="subtitle process-description">As the other UX Designers produced low-fidelity iOS wireframes and began testing the app on users, I began reading through <a href="https://material.google.com/">Google’s Material design</a> and researching how to design an Android version of our app.</p>
            <p class="subtitle process-description">Material provided its shares of challenges. As my design partners gave insight into how the prototype would eventually look, as they designed and iterated, it became clear to me than an Android app was not a mere translation of an iOS app.</p>

            <h2 class="title-1 process-headline">Next Steps</h2>
            <p class="subtitle process-description">There are several short and long term steps my team and I can take to further improve our <b>MTA Kiosk</b> app.</p> In the short-term, I would develop those wireframes into a working prototype to test on Android users, as mockups for an Android app are complete.</p>
            <p class="subtitle process-description">Regarding <b>long-term steps</b>, I would want to seek out and interview individuals of other age brackets, specifically, older individuals. Nearly 96% of our 49 initial survey respondents were between the ages of 18–40, and it would be unfair to automatically assume that any one outside of this age group would not use our app. Interviewing and taking insights from older individuals would help us cater to all MTA users.</p>
